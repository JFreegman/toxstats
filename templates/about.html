All <div class="tooltip">UDP-enabled<span class="tooltiptext">Most clients enable UDP by default, with an exception for mobile clients</span></div> Tox clients—referred to as nodes—are a part of this network.

    <p>The statistics displayed on this website represent a low-end approximation of unique nodes within the network.</p>
